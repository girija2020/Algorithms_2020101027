WAYS OF SOLVING PROBLEMS

In this class we have seen the different ways to solve a problem.

1. Computing the n th fibonacci number.

Algorithm 1: 

Pseudo code:

function fib(n):

  if n=0 return 0;    //since the second term must be 1, and the first term is 1, the zeroeth term can be named 0
  
  else if n=1 return 1;   //since the first term is 1
  
  else return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);   //from definition
  

This code is a recursive code. If any number greater than 1 is passed as an arguement to the function, it meets fib(n-1) and fib(n-2). There the function fib is called again twice. Then it continues executing each, till both of them reach fib(1) + fib(0), where it stops executing. 

The time taken for this code is :   = T(fib(n)) 
                                    
                                    = T(fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)) + T(1) 
                                    
                                    = T(fib(n-1)) + T(fib(n-2)) + T(1)
                                    
                                    = T(fib(n-2)) + T(fib(n-3)) + T(1) + T(fib(n-3)) + T(fib(n-4)) + T(1) + T(1)
                                    
                                    
                                    = ..... + T(1) + T(0) + .......         the first T(0) + T(1) occurs at n/2
                                    
                                    .......
                                    
                                    = T(1) * (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ..... 2^(n/2) + 2^(n/2-1) + .... + 2 + 1)
                                    
                                    = T(1) * [2 * (2^(n/2)) - 2 + 2^(n/2)]
                                    
                                    = T(1) * [3 * 2^(n/2)) - 2]
                                    
                                    = T(3 * 2^(n/2) - 2)    //seems wrong work on it again
                                    
                                    
                                    












Week 2 Lecture 2:

Divide And Conquer

Master's proof:

Master's theorem is used to give the time complexity of recurrence relations of the form:

T(n) = a*T(n/b) + O(n^r)

Here a is the branching factor. That is, it is similar to a tree with each branch giving rise to a branches and the maximum height of the tree is log n (base b). Since for maximum height n/b^d = 1 => n = b^d => log n (base b) = d. => d levels of maximum branching.

The work done in the first level is O(n^r);

In the second one, a*T(n/b) = a*a*T(n/b^2) + a*O(n/b ^ r). That is a*O(n/b ^ r)

the third one follows from the above. a^2 * O(n/b^2 ^ r) = (a/b^r)^2 * O(n^r)

....

....

go on

The kth level would be (a/b^r)^k * O(n^r)

....

....

Hence the total work done follows to be: sigma k = 1 to k = log n (base b) =>> ( (a/b^r)^k * O(n^r) )

Now we divulge further into the following cases:

1) r < log a (base b) : log n (base b) * O(n ^ r) * (a/b) [(a/b^r)^log n(base b) - 1]/[a/b^r - 1].

The geometric ratio of this term is > 1. Hence time complexity depends on the last term the largest term 

                                       = O(n ^ r) [(a/b^r)^log n(base b)]
                                       
                                       = O(n ^ r * a^log n(base b)/(b^r)^log n(base b)]
                                       
                                       = O(n ^ r * n^(log b (base a))/n^r)    from properties of logarithms
                                       
                                       = O(n ^ (log a (base b))
                                       
2) r > log a (base b) : The geometric ratio of this term is < 1. Hence the first term is the largest term and determines the time complexity.
                                       
                                       = O(n ^ r * a/b)
                                       
                                       = O(n ^ r)
                                       
3) r = log a (base b) : => a = b^r
                                       = O(n ^ r *  log n(base b)
                

And thus all the three cases have been proved.
